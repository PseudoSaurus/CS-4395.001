# What is the contents of this PDF?

In this PDF, it will conatin a Google colab page print of my work for Portfolio Assigmnent 2: NLTK.
For this assignemnt, we are tasked in answering 8 questions and programming task all in NTLK. 
In the same order as the PDF, these are the questions for the assignment:

   1.  Look at the tokens() method. Extract 
        the first 20 tokens from text1. List two things you learned about the tokens() method or Text 
        objects in the text cell above this code cell
  
  2.   Look at the concordance() method in the API. Using the documentation to guide you, in code, 
        print a concordance for text1 word 'sea', selecting only 5 lines. 
  
  3.   Look at the count() method in the API. How does this work, and how is it different or 
        the same as Python's count method? Write your commentary above the code cell. In the code 
        cells, experiment with both count() methods. 
  
  4.   Using raw text of at least 5 sentences of your choice from any source (cite the source),
        save the text into a variable called raw_text. Using NLTK's word tokenizer, tokenize the text into 
        variable 'tokens'. Print the first 10 tokens. 

  5.  Using the same raw text, and NLTK's sentence tokenizer sent_tokenize(), perform 
        sentence segmentation and display the sentences. 

  6.  Using NLTK's PorterStemmer(), write a list comprehension to stem the text. Display 
       the list
       
  7.   Using NLTK's WordNetLemmatizer, write a list comprehension to lemmatize the text. 
        Display the list. In the text cell above this code cell, list at 
        least 5 differences you see in the stems verses the lemmas.
        You can just write them each on a line, like this: 
          stem-lemma
  
  8.   Comment cell: Write a paragraph outlining:
            a. your opinion of the functionality of the NLTK library
            b. your opinion of the code quality of the NLTK library
            c. a list of ways you may use NLTK in future projects
