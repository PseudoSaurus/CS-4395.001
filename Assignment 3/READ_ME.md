# Assignment Overview

In my program, I read in a text file and tokenized, lemmanized, and counted the most important words from the file.
This program also has a great word guessing game. The words that the system show to the user were sourced from
the text file only that we seperated the most important words that have more than 5 letters

## How to run the code.
  
  First, make sure you have a compatible IDE for python 3.8 or higher.
  Once you have you system ready, please download the data file and the 
    python program named GussingGame_SGG180002 
  
 By opening the python file to your respected IDE, in the console
    type in this: python main.py anat19.txt
  
## How does the code work?
  
  This code functions on if the user inputs the exact file name.
  The code will read in the file name and store the information into the filename string to be passed on to function in HLPfile.
  
  Once we tour every method in the HLPfile, the guessing game can finally begin.  
       
  ## Where does this code fail in
    
    One huge flaw in my guessing games is that when the player would enter in nothing, the system will grant the player a
    point and continue the game. 
   
 ## Lessons learned
    
    This assignment served me as a great reminder of how I am improving my python skills.
    Using multiple python files makes the code more organized and readable.
    I have learn that python can return multiple object from a method call.
