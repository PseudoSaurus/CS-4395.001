# What I have learned and practiced?

  In this course assignment, I practiced my drawing skills of constructing and understanding
  a Phrase Structure Grammer Parsing, Dependency Parsing, and Semantic Role Label Parsing. With my 
  constructed sentence:
  
    [*] As Daith√≠ climbs down one branch at a time, he glance up to see someone 
wiping tears from their eyes.
  
  I utilized each parsing method and reviewed the phrase terms, dependency relations, and verb modifiers 
  thanks to the parsing methods.
